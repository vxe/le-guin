* Installation
  - require this in your repl
* Usage
  - one function is provided called ~use-method~ , which takes a vector of host names and executes the playbook on it
    - [experimental] additionally the function ~le-guin~ will execute a custom playbook so long as its looked in the [[file:playbooks/][playbooks]] directory in the project root 
* Extending
  - [ ] expose more ansible functionality
  - [ ] generate playbooks on the fly
  - [ ] find a less hacky when to generate the inventory, perhaps using [[https://github.com/pieterbreed/ansible-inventory-clj][this]]
  - [ ] compojure and ring are included in the project, 'ansible as a service' is a possibility
